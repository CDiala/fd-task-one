# fd-task-one
This project shows a list of my hobbies. 

Basically, it consists of plain HTML, no CSS. Semantic HTML was implemented as much as I could (not the best though).

[Here's](cdiala.github.io/fd-task-one/) a link to the project hosted on GitHub Pages, and [here's](https://fd-task-one.netlify.app) a link to the project hosted on Netlify.

Enjoy!
